This is an important milestone to say "goodbye" to close the good student days and say "hello" to maturity when it comes to making decisions for your future career path.
Graduation is always the most memorable moment of my student days and i look forward to sharing that moment with my loved ones. And what could be happier than when everyone is there to preserve that good memory. I would like my friends and my family to spend some precious time attending my graduation ceremony.
